## Hey Everyone

I'm working on a few things at the moment. I can't quite find the time to do everything I want, but that's the struggle of life I guess.

My cuurrent focus is split in half:
- Connectivity to the Interactive Broker API (May expand to Binance later on as it's cheaper to access crypto market data)
- Data Science & Machine Learning (Python -> Numpy -> SciPy -> Pandas -> Scikit-Learn (et al.) -> Vertex AI / AWS SageMaker)


- **Flagship Projects:**
  - [Market Analysis](https://github.com/aymanecheikh/algo-trading)
    - Connecting to Interactive Broker API and creating and creating an interface that allows me to query market data (in a specific way) and place orders.
    - The vision is to have a pipeline that fetches securities that makes it through the screener and use for preprocessing for an AI/ML pipeline.
