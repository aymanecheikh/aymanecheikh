## Hey Everyone

I'm working on a few things at the moment. I can't quite find the time to do everything I want, but that's the struggle of life I guess.

My cuurrent focus is as follows:
- Building a financial analysis machine (my flagship project)
- Slowly building an exposure to cloud computing (GCP & AWS)
- Training my data science and programming skills:
  - Numpy
  - Scipy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-Learn & Others
  - C++
- Practicing data science with random projects


- **Flagship Projects:**
  - [Market Analysis](https://github.com/aymanecheikh/quantitative-finance)
    - Connecting to Interactive Broker API and creating and creating an interface that allows me to query market data (in a specific way) and place orders.
    - Build a scanner that fetches stocks based on specific criteria and fetches their historical data going back 10 years.
    - Perform statistical analysis of said stocks.
    - The vision is to have a pipeline that fetches securities that makes it through the screener and use for preprocessing for an AI/ML pipeline.
- **Alternative Repos:**
  - [C++ Practice](https://github.com/aymanecheikh/cpp-practice)
    - Learning C++ basics with the goal of reaching the same level of proficiency as I have with Python.
    - Start integrating C++ into my flagship projects or building another flagsip project based exclusively on C++.
  - **Dormant Repos:**
    - [Numpy Practice with Simulated Sensor Data](https://github.com/aymanecheikh/sensor-data)
    - [Numpy Practice with Loan Data](https://github.com/aymanecheikh/loan-data)
    - [Basic Kubeflow Pipeline Attempt with Vertex AI](https://github.com/aymanecheik/market-prediction)
